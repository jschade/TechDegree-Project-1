        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm an aspiring web developer that's currently enrolled in the TechDegree program offered by Team Treehouse. I started learning about web design in the mid 90s, when I taught myself HTML in high school. I furthered my learning later on in life by teaching myself some of the basic CSS and Photoshop skills needed to make simple websites. I decided to take the TechDegree program to enhance my skills and gain further knowledge of web development. I love being creative and I'm excited to learn with Team Treehouse.</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a small town in Maine and I'm currently residing in the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia. I've had a lot of unique job experiences, but my most interesting one is my current position as an axe-throwing instructor. If you're ever in town, you should stop by the Timber Lounge and toss a few axes with me. It's nice to have a break from coding sometimes, you know?</p>
