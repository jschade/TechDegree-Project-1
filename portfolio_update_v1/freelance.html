        <h3>Yoga in the Commons</h3>
        <p>A good friend of mine is a Yoga Instructor here in Halifax. She was looking for a simple and eloquent website for her summer business teaching outdoor yoga in the Halifax Commons.</p>
        Website URL: <a href="http://www.yogainthecommons.com" target="_blank">www.yogainthecommons.com</a>
        <p>What I did:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Created logo</em></li>
          <li><em>Designed HTML and CSS</em></li>
          <li><em>Set up domain and hosting</em></li>
          <li><em>Set up email accounts</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>I ran into a few challenges during this project. First off, it had been a few years since I had done any web or graphic design. I used this project as a way to ease myself back into HTML and CSS coding. This was also my first time ever working with a Lighbtox image gallery, so I had to take my time to make that work properly. The most challenging aspect of this project was attempting to make the contact form work with PHP, a language I had never used before and have no used since. I'm still in the process of figuring out how to make it work properly.</p>

        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>I by no means consider myself to be an extraodinary graphic designer, but I have a lot of fun with these simple little projects. Here you will be able to view any graphic projects that I have recently worked on:</p>
        <h3>Dude's Foods Menu Design</h3>
        <p>I was approached to do a simple menu for a friend's weekend breakfast delivery company. Due to company having a fun name, I wanted to do something very simple, but fun and colorful, hence the sunny-colored theme of the menu.</p>

          <h3>Timber Lounge, Open Lanes Image</h3>
          <p>I work for the Timber Lounge as an axe-throwing coach. I also do a lot of work and posts on our Instagram page. I was tasked with creating a basic image that we can upload when we have open lanes so we can use social media to hopefully bring in walk-ins during our downtime between large events.</p>
